To find LetterPersons tagged as 'old age' or 'ageing' within a particular collection (411 is the Woollocombe)

Where we are looking to create csv files of particular authors (that we know are old) and send the normalised transcription to Tunan

select rp.first_name, rp.last_name, rl.sent_date_year, rl.transcription_normalized 
from researchdata_letter rl 
left join researchdata_letterperson lp on rl.id = lp.letter_id 
left join researchdata_person rp on rp.id = lp.person_id
where rl.sent_date_year BETWEEN 1809 and 1820
and rp.first_name is 'John' and rp.last_name is 'Glover';

And isolating these by persons that were primary authors
select rp.first_name, rp.last_name, rl.sent_date_year, rl.transcription_normalized 
--select *
from researchdata_letter rl 
left join researchdata_letterperson lp on rl.id = lp.letter_id 
left join researchdata_person rp on rp.id = lp.person_id
where rl.sent_date_year BETWEEN 1743 and 1820
and rp.first_name is 'Elizabeth' and rp.last_name is 'Elstob'
and person_letter_relationship_id is '278';

Where we are looking for a list of letter writers and their age at writing using the year_active_start date in the database

select distinct p.id, first_name, last_name, year_of_birth, year_active_start, (year_of_birth - year_active_start) as 'age at writing'
from researchdata_person p
left join researchdata_letterperson lp on p.id = lp.person_id 
where lp.person_letter_relationship_id is 278
and p.year_of_birth is not not null and year_active_start is not null
order by "age at writing" desc;


Where we are looking for a list of letter writers and their age at writing using the date of the letter, and year_of_birth
select distinct rl.id, rp.first_name, rp.last_name, rl.sent_date_year, rp.year_of_birth, (sent_date_year - year_of_birth) as 'age at writing'
from researchdata_letter rl 
left join researchdata_letterperson lp on rl.id = lp.letter_id 
left join researchdata_person rp on rp.id = lp.person_id
where rp.year_of_birth is NOT NULL
order by "age at writing" desc;

As above, but making sure that they are letter writers rather than subjects
select distinct rl.id, rp.first_name, rp.last_name, rl.sent_date_year, rp.year_of_birth, (sent_date_year - year_of_birth) as 'age at writing'
from researchdata_letter rl 
left join researchdata_letterperson lp on rl.id = lp.letter_id 
left join researchdata_person rp on rp.id = lp.person_id
where rp.year_of_birth is NOT NULL and person_letter_relationship_id is '278'
