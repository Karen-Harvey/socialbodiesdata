1.	Build a list of all letter person records and their bodily activities (showing 2 columns: letter person id, bodily activity name)

select letterperson_id, genba.name as 'bodily activity' 
from researchdata_letterperson_bodily_activity lpba
left join researchdata_slgeneric genba on slletterpersonbodilyactivity_id = genba.id

2.	Show all letter person records and bodily activities (i.e. the above list) but only for the bodily activity of ‘travel’

select letterperson_id, genba.name as 'bodily activity' 
from researchdata_letterperson_bodily_activity lpba
left join researchdata_slgeneric genba on slletterpersonbodilyactivity_id = genba.id
where genba.name is 'travel'

3.	How many letter person records relate to the ‘travel’ bodily activity? (tip: use the count() function)

select count (*) letterperson_id, genba.name as 'bodily activity' 
from researchdata_letterperson_bodily_activity lpba
left join researchdata_slgeneric genba on slletterpersonbodilyactivity_id = genba.id
where genba.name is 'travel'

4.	Repeat the first 3 questions for ‘emotions’ (limit by ‘regret’)
 
select letterperson_id, genem.name as 'emotion' 
from researchdata_letterperson_emotion lpe
left join researchdata_slgeneric genem on slletterpersonemotion_id = genem.id

select letterperson_id, genem.name as 'emotion' 
from researchdata_letterperson_emotion lpe
left join researchdata_slgeneric genem on slletterpersonemotion_id = genem.id
where genem.name is 'regret'

select count (*) letterperson_id, genem.name as 'emotion' 
from researchdata_letterperson_emotion lpe
left join researchdata_slgeneric genem on slletterpersonemotion_id = genem.id
where genem.name is 'regret'

Multiple many to joins
5.	Repeat the first 3 questions but for a combination of ‘sensations’ (limit by ‘pain’) and ‘roles’ (limit by ‘motherhood’) in a single list.
(Tip: Your list for this question should now show 3 columns: letter person id, sensation name, and role name. Limiting the list (i.e. using the where clause) should be done using ‘pain’ AND ‘motherhood’.
 
ANSWER to ‘pain’ and ‘motherhood’:
select lpsen.letterperson_id, gensen.name as 'sensation', genrole.name as 'role' 
from researchdata_letterperson_sensation lpsen
left join researchdata_slgeneric gensen on slletterpersonsensation_id = gensen.id
left join researchdata_letterperson_roles lprole  
left join researchdata_slgeneric genrole on lprole.slletterpersonrole_id = genrole.id 
where gensen.name IS 'pain' and genrole.name is 'motherhood';

Workings out:
[select letterperson_id, gensen.name as 'sensation'
from researchdata_letterperson_sensation lpsen
left join researchdata_slgeneric gensen on slletterpersonsensation_id = gensen.id

select *
from researchdata_letterperson_sensation lpsen
left join researchdata_slgeneric gensen on slletterpersonsensation_id = gensen.id
left join researchdata_letterperson_roles lprole]

ANSWER TO ‘pain’ and all ‘roles’

select lpsen.letterperson_id, gensen.name as 'sensation', genrole.name as 'role' 
from researchdata_letterperson_sensation lpsen
left join researchdata_slgeneric gensen on slletterpersonsensation_id = gensen.id
left join researchdata_letterperson_roles lprole  
left join researchdata_slgeneric genrole on lprole.slletterpersonrole_id = genrole.id 
where gensen.name = 'pain'

To count pain refs:

select count (*), lpsen.letterperson_id, gensen.name as 'sensation', genrole.name as 'role' 
from researchdata_letterperson_sensation lpsen
left join researchdata_slgeneric gensen on slletterpersonsensation_id = gensen.id
left join researchdata_letterperson_roles lprole  
left join researchdata_slgeneric genrole on lprole.slletterpersonrole_id = genrole.id 
where gensen.name = 'pain'

Total pain = 178,869?!

To count refs with ‘pain’ and ‘motherhood’:
select count (*), lpsen.letterperson_id, gensen.name as 'sensation', genrole.name as 'role' 
from researchdata_letterperson_sensation lpsen
left join researchdata_slgeneric gensen on slletterpersonsensation_id = gensen.id
left join researchdata_letterperson_roles lprole  
left join researchdata_slgeneric genrole on lprole.slletterpersonrole_id = genrole.id 
where gensen.name IS 'pain' and genrole.name is 'motherhood';
